The following is my first solo project. The purpose of my project was to know if I can build a calculator with some basic functions. 

I’m trying to practice my new skills with Javascript, CSS & Html. The javascript start with a little loop to animate the “Calculator” header. After that, the main function works with a simple object with keys/values that hold the display, number & operator.

You can;

-	Reset with the C button.
-	Division/multiplication/subtraction & addition.
-	Change the operator as you want (after the total or with the current operation).
-	When the total button is pressed, numbers are blocked to not cause error.
-	Display the operation / operator & total on the upper side of the “screen”.

Mostly happy with the result right now. There’s some small bug but this will be fix with the upcoming update and more features will be added after that.
