The following is my first solo project. The purpose of my project was to know if I can build a calculator with some basic functions. 

I’m trying to practice my new skills with Javascript, CSS & Html. The javascript start with a little loop to animate the “Calculator” header. After that, the main function works with a simple object with keys/values that hold the display, number & operator.

You can;

-	Reset with the C button.
-	Division/multiplication/subtraction & addition.
-	Change the operator as you want (after the total or with the current operation).
-	When the total button is pressed, numbers are blocked to not cause error.
-	Display the operation / operator & total on the upper side of the “screen”.

Mostly happy with the result right now. There’s some small bug and I forgot to add the number ‘0’, this will be fix with the upcoming update and more features will be added after that.
